# Enable Zoom App Real Time Media Streams: Media-accessing apps

This repository hosts a web-based Google Codelab that walks developers through enabling Real Time Media Streams (RTMS) for Zoom Apps. The tutorial covers app prerequisites, updating Marketplace metadata with the Manifest API, enabling RTMS at install time, and configuring account settings to auto-open an RTMS-enabled app.

## Prerequisites
- Code editor and terminal
- Zoom Developer Account with RTMS enabled

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a web browser. Each step explains how RTMS works and includes a sample Manifest JSON object showing required scopes, event subscriptions, and app options.
